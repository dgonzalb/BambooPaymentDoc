### Flow description

| N° | Description | /EndPoint or Actor |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The Merchant sends the [purchase request]({{< ref "Purchase-Operations" >}}#create-a-purchase) with the `PaymentMediaId` of the corresponding payment method.  | `/purchase` |
| 2 | Bamboo returns the Purchase, with status _Pending for Redirection_, and a `CommerceAction` object containing an external service URL. `ActionReason = REDIRECTION_NEEDED_EXTERNAL_SERVICE` | `/purchase response` |
| 3 | The merchant must redirect the customer to the external service URL provided in the `CommerceAction` object. | `Commerce Site/Client browser` |
| 4 | Bamboo automatically redirects customers to an external payment processor to complete payment. | `Bamboo Site/Customer browser` |
| 5 | The customer follows the steps shown by the acquirer's site to complete the payment. | `External Payment Site/Client` |
| 6 | Bamboo receives the response is received and processes and updates the transaction status. Then, Bamboo redirects back to the merchant's response page (According to transaction status). | `/paymentCallback` |
| 7 | Bamboo receives an async push notification from acquire and notify back to the merchant's notification webhook (the purchase status is updated). |` /webhook (Merchant)` |

## Response URLS
As the result of the transaction, it can be in any of the following statuses.

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| Approved | Purchase approved. No verification is needed. |
| Rejected | Purchase rejected. |
| Canceled | The customer or an automatic process has canceled the purchase. |
| Pending | The purchase is pending to be paid in a Cash Payment network, or to be confirmed by the payment method processor. |

Therefore, the following URLs are defined to be sent in the Purchase when the same host-to-host is created before the redirection: 

* `Url_Approved` → callback URL when the purchase status is `Approved` 
* `Url_Rejected` → callback URL when the purchase status is `Rejected` 
* `Url_Canceled` → callback URL when the purchase status is `Canceled` 
* `Url_Pending`  → callback URL when the purchase status is `Pending` 
* `Url_Notify`   → webhook notification URL. The Purchase status is notified to this URL once the payment method processor notifies Bamboo. The notification to this URL is a REST POST with JSON payload instead of redirection. It can also be static and configured by Support Team.

### Redirect Flow Purchase example

```json
{
    "TrxToken":"OT__Kg1JdcN4Fz6g7RUCF_xdtbR5n0FVX4IctD__P3BSApY_",
    "Capture":"true",
    "Amount":10000000,
    "Installments":1,
    "Currency": "CLP",,
    "TargetCountryISO": "CL",
    "PaymentMediaId":106,
    "Redirection" : {
      "Url_Approved": "https://dummystore.com/checkout/approved",
      "Url_Rejected": "https://dummystore.com/checkout/rejected",
      "Url_Canceled": "https://dummystore.com/checkout/canceled",
      "Url_Pending": "https://dummystore.com/checkout/pending",
      "Url_Notify": "https://dummystore.com/checkout/notifications"
    }
}
```
<br>

The _**PaymentMediaId**_ and _**TrxToken**_ fields are optional, but it is mandatory to send one of them, depending on the flow you want to use.

* _**PaymentMediaId**_: Alternative payment method identifier (transfer, cash, and processing that requires customer redirection). You can obtain this identifier by consulting the [Payment methods by country section](/en/docs/payment-methods.html).
* _**TrxToken**_: You can pre-generate the token and process the purchase by sending it in this field.

### Redirect response content
The redirection callback response contains the `PurchaseID` and `Status` as `FORM` data (input data).

```html
<form method="post" action="https://dummystore.com/checkout/approved">
  <input type="hidden" id="PurchaseId" name="PurchaseId" value="198742" />
  <input type="hidden" id="Status" name="Status" value="approved" />
</form>
```

There is no validation system, so we don't recommend taking the response as final. Instead, take the `PurchaseId` and perform a **GET** request (server to server) to `/v1/api//api/Purchase/{ID}` to get the complete Purchase Object and its final status.
