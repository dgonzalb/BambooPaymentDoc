The fields **CardData**, **PaymentMethodId**, **NetworkToken** and **TrxToken** are not required; Nevertheless, one of them must be send depending of which flow to use.

* **CardData**: Must be used for transactions using non-tokenized cards.

* **PaymentMediaId**: Identifier of alternative payment method (Bank Transfer, cash or any flow needing a redirection of the client). This identifier can be found in the [Payment Methods by Country](/en/docs/payment-methods.html) section.

* **TrxToken**: The merchant can generate a token and use it to generate transactions if necessary.

* **NetworkToken**: A secure token that replaces actual card details in the transaction process. These tokens are stored in vaults maintained by card networks. Currently, we support Network Tokens from Visa and Mastercard. **PaymentMethodId** is mandatory when sending a Network Token.

## Response Example
The response structure for Direct Purchase operations performed by PCI-compliant merchants is identical to the standard Purchase response. This ensures consistency across different transaction types and simplifies integration processes.

For a detailed breakdown of all possible fields in the response, including descriptions and data types, please refer to the [Basic Operations](/en/docs/versions/purchase-operations-v3.html#response-parameters) section. All fields, statuses, and error codes described in the standard Purchase response apply equally to Direct Purchase transactions.
