Next, we describe the steps to create a purchase with an anonymous user.

## Capture the Card Data
The first step is to get the token of the customer's card. To do so, you can invoke the [Checkout Form]({{< ref "Checkout-Form.md" >}}) in the last stage of the shopping cart. Recall that you must gather the _**Checkout Form**_ through the Bamboo Payment JavaScript library. Alternatively, you can use [Direct tokenization]({{< ref "Direct-Tokenization.md" >}}) if your commerce is PCI-compliant.

This form is displayed within an iframe of your page and requests the Card data.

If you use the Alternative payment method identifier, you don't require this step and must include the **PaymentMediaId**.
{{% /alert %}}

### Invoking the Checkout Form
The JavaScript **PWCheckout** library has properties to customize its appearance according to merchant requirements. Once you invoke the Checkout form and the customer fills in the data, the merchant can obtain the _token_ associated with the customer's card. 

### Using Direct tokenization
Since the user is not registered in your commerce, you must invoke the method to [create the token for unregistered users]({{< ref "Direct-Tokenization.md" >}}#OTT).

{{% alert title="Info" color="info"%}}
The token generated using any method above is a _**One Time Token**_ (OTT) valid only once and for 10 minutes.
{{% /alert %}}

## Create a Basic Purchase
The token just obtained must be sent from the browser or the mobile app to the application server to create the purchase transaction.

From the server, invoke the [Create a Purchase]({{< ref "Purchase-Operations.md" >}}#create-a-purchase), including the `Purchase` object with the token and other transaction data.

```json
{
  "TrxToken": "OT_01_kYv0qTHckRiZ4wjCz5NguZRuwFLSIrQc4jiYpVJ8SzQ_",
  "Order": "17030613595101621fb",
  "Amount": 123456,
  "Currency": "USD",
  "Capture": true,
  "TargetCountryISO":"CL",
  "PaymentMediaId":106
}
```

The **PaymentMediaId** and **TrxToken** fields are optional, but sending one is mandatory, depending on the flow you want to use.

* **PaymentMediaId**: Alternative payment method identifier (transfer, cash, and processing that requires customer redirection). You can obtain this identifier by consulting the [Payment Methods by country](/en/docs/payment-methods.html) section.

* **TrxToken**: You can generate the token and transact by sending it in this field.

## Payment Workflow Sequence Diagram
The following sequence diagram lists the steps in the payment process.

In the above flow, the following calls are made:

* **10** - `HTTP/POST` (server to server): `{EnvironmentAPI}/v1/api/purchase`
* **12** - `HTTP/GET `(server to server): `{EnvironmentAPI}/v1/api/customer/{{customer-id}}`
