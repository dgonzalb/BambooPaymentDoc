## Device Fingerprint

### JavaScript Library Import
The invocation of the fingerprint service is found in a JavaScript library, which must be imported into the client's web page directly from a public URL on our platform.

The JavaScript snippet records user interactions with your website and collects device information. <br>

In the call to said library, the public key of the trading account (PublicAccountKey) must be included (as a parameter), which will be used for calls to the REST API from this library.

```html
<script src="{API_Environment}/v1/Scripts/Antifraud.js?key={PublicAccountKey}" type="text/javascript"></script> 
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning"%}}
You must import the library through the public URL provided by Bamboo Payment. It should not be downloaded and used locally from a merchant's own server or from a URL of a third party not authorized by Bamboo Payment.

This is important for security reasons and to always keep up-to-date with the latest modifications and corrections made to it.

## Methods

### getSessionAntifraud
This method returns the `SessionId` of the fingerprint (string). The `SessionId` is the data that must be passed in the API invocation at the time of purchase in the `AntifraudFingerprintId` parameter.
