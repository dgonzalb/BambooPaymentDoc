## Import of the JavaScript Library 
You can find the functionalities of the Checkout form in a JavaScript library, which must be imported into the client’s website directly from a public URL of our platform.

The call to this library must include (as a parameter) the public key of the commerce account (`PublicAccountKey`) which you will use for calls to the API REST from this library.

```html
<script src="{api_environment}/v1/Scripts/PWCheckout.js?key={PublicAccountKey}" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info"%}}
You must import the library through the public URL provided by Bamboo Payment. It must not be downloaded and used locally from a merchant’s server or from a URL of a third party not authorized by Bamboo Payment.

This is important for security reasons and to keep updated with the latest modifications and corrections.

## Methods
### SetProperties
This method establishes the visual properties (texts and images) used in the Checkout window.

All properties are optional, except for the `form_id` property. So, the call to the `SetProperties` method is mandatory at least to establish this property, and you must invoke it before the opening of the Checkout form.

This method describes configurable parameters when the _Verified By Visa_ page is returned. 

All the properties are optional, so the call to the _SetStyleForVbV_ method is optional. If you don't invoke this method, the page appears full width on the screen. 

To set these properties, invoke the method before opening the Checkout form.

    "margin": "auto"
  }
);
</script>
```

### Bind
Use this method to subscribe to the events the `PWCheckout` library can trigger.

To receive the events generated by this form, invoke the method before opening the Checkout form window.

| Property | Description | Mandatory? |
| ---------|-------------|:----------:|
| **eventName (string)** | Name of the event to which you want to subscribe (see events [below](#events)). | Yes |
| **callbackName (JavaScript Function)** | JavaScript function that will process the event. | Yes |

{{% alert title="Note" color="info"%}}
You must implement the javascript function that processes the Event (if required).
{{% /alert %}}

<br>

Example:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
function WindowIsOpen(){
  console.log("Checkout Window is Open");
}
PWCheckout.Bind("opened", WindowIsOpen);
</script>
```

#### Events
The `PWCheckout` library exposes the following javascript events to which you can subscribe using the [Bind](#bind) method.

| Event | Description | Parameters |
|-------------|-----------|:-----:|
| **opened** | The event is triggered when the payment card capture form opens. | - |
| **closed** | The event is triggered when the payment card capture form was closed. | `CloseInfo` |
| **tokenCreated** | The event is triggered the Token created for the captured payment card was received. | `TokenInfo` |
| **notificationReceived** | The event is triggered the Verification Code Request Flow was completed. | `NotificationInfo` |
| **onTokenCreateError** | Event that is triggered when an error is generated when generating a Token. | `TokenInfo` |


### Unbind
This method removes the subscription to an event previously made by the [Bind](#bind) method.

| Property | Description | Mandatory? |
| ---------|-------------|:-----:|
| **eventName (string)** | Name of the event whose subscription you want to remove.  | Yes |


Example:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
PWCheckout.Unbind("opened", WindowIsOpen);
</script>
```

## Invoking the form 
The Checkout Form invocation web page must include a hidden input field named `PWToken`. The JavaScript library will set the field's value after obtaining the Token.

Create the field in the following way:

```html
    <input type="hidden" name="PWToken" id="PWToken" />
```
<br>

To start the payment process, you must link the page element that will make the call to the Payment Card Capture Form. This element can be a button, image or any active element you want to link. 

You must call the AddActionButton method of the `PWCheckout` library as follows:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  PWCheckout.AddActionButton("buttonId");
</script>
```
<br>

The parameter `buttonId` refers to the identifier of the element that triggers the payment process.

Multiple elements can be associated in the same call, identifying each one by its ID and separating each identifier with a comma.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  PWCheckout.AddActionButton("buttonId1", "buttonId2", "buttonId3");
</script>
```
<br>

After performing this step, the payment process is invoked when the customer presses the linked element.

Once this invocation finishes, the JavaScript library manages the process, showing the user the form where the payment card information is requested.

When the customer enters the data of their card, our servers tokenize the information and send the Token to the `PWCheckout` library

The value of the generated Token is automatically inserted in the hidden field `PWToken`, and finally, the javascript library PWCheckout performs the following actions:

1. Trigger the `tokenCreated` Event.
2. Submit the form if the property `autoSubmit` is `true`.

You need to process payment form data, including the value in the `PWToken` field, and send the relevant information described in the[ API's Purchase section]({{< ref Purchase-Operations.md >}}).

## Invoking the form with validation filters
If you need to validate the entry of a particular card, either by the brand or the issuing bank, you must proceed to the personalized opening of the Card Capture Form. Use an explicit method for validating data.

The method to be used is the **OpenIframeWithPaymentMediaOptions**, which receives the following parameters:
* **PaymentMediaId**: Identifier of the payment method in the gateway (see [table](/docs/payment-methods.html#payment-method-types) Payment method types).
* **BankId**: Bank identifier on the gateway (see [table](/docs/payment-methods/uruguay.html#issuer-banks-table) Issuer Bank).
* **PaymentMediaType**: Payment method type identifier  (see [table](/docs/payment-methods/uruguay.html#payment-methods) Payment methods).


Invocation example of **OpenIframeWithPaymentMediaOptions**:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  PWCheckout.Iframe.OpenIframeWithPaymentMediaOptions(paymentMediaId, bankId, paymentMediaType);
</script>
```
