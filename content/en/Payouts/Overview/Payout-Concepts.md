## Balance
The _Balance_ is the amount of money settled in your account. We have three different balances for Payouts; consult those types [here]({{< ref "Payout-Balances" >}}).

## Banking Connections
The _Banking Connection_ technology allows us to send money to a payee regardless of the selected payment method.

## FX Service
_Foreign Exchange_ or _FX_ refers to the current rate to convert one country's currency to another. This value is updated according to destination country regulations.  

## Payee
A _Payee_ is a third party who will receive the money result of your Payout request. The information required for a _Payee_ is their name, document, phone, e-mail address, and bank account.

## Payout
_Payout_ refers to disbursing funds to a third party using funds settled in your account. 

## Payout fee
The _Payout fee_ refers to the processing cost of the Payout. This cost can be assumed by you (as a Payer) or taken by the Payee by setting a variable in the request.

## Sanction screening
_Sanction screening_ ets us know if the merchant is making payouts to legally sanctioned persons. This process is essential as an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Payout limits control.

The output of this process determines whether the _Payout_ requires manual validation.
