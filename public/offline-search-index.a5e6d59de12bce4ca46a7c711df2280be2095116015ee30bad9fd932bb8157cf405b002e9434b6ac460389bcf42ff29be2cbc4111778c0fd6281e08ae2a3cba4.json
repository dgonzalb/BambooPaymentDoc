Furthermore, the acquirer is the responsible of the payments and manages the settlement to your banking account.\nAPI An API (from the acronym Application Programming Interface) is a set of methods and definitions that allows you to interact with a system through some input data. In our case, the API is defined to allow you process the information of a transaction to receive the response related to it.\nAuthentication Authentication is the procedure to validate the identity of a merchant. All merchants integrated with our platform receive a pair of keys for each associated account Private Account Key and Public Account Key.\nEach one of these keys identifies the merchant account in our system in each transaction performed to determine whether the merchant is authorized to operate and what are the conditions of the integration (For example, what payment methods are enabled for the merchant).\nPrivate Account Key The Private Account Key is a unique identifier that must be attached to each private request (server to server) where critical operations are available, such as initiating or confirming a transaction, accessing merchant transaction information, creating or deleting subscription plans, etc.\nImportant The Private Account Key must not be shared or publicly exposed at any time, to not compromise the security of the integration. It is the merchant’s responsibility to keep it safe.\nPublic Account Key The Public Account key is unique identifier that must be attached to each public request (made from the web interface) for query operations or for data capture request.\nFurthermore, this key is also used when invoking the PWCheckout Javascript library.\nCheckout The checkout is the form where your customers select the payment method they want to use to complete the payment. According to the payment method, this form allows you to collect its information and send it to process the transaction.\nCVV CVV stands for Card Verification Value. It is a three- or four-digit security code of the credit or debit cards. The CVV is an additional security measure to verify that the person making an online or over-the-phone transaction has physical possession of the card.\nEnvironment The Environment is the set of software and resources that allows you to process the transactions. Depending on its type, the environment has real or test data and information. Our platform has two separate environments: Stage and Production.\nStage This environment allows you to perform testing tasks. Here, the transactions never reach the real systems of the payment method providers. It\u0026rsquo;s a safe way to try out tasks and flows.\nBase URL: https://api.stage.bamboopayment.com. Production This environment allows you to perform real transactions and they are processed by the actual system of the payment methods you have. Before starting to process transactions in this environment, it\u0026rsquo;s strongly recommended to test in Stage.\nBase URL: https://api.bamboopayment.com. Note Throughout our documentation, we refer to the URLs where the services are exposed as {environment_api}, this must be replaced by the URL corresponding to the environment where you are working.\nForm A Form is a web component that allows you to embed a set of fields to tokenize a card or perform a purchase using a payment method. For more information, refer to Forms.\nFX Service Foreign Exchange or FX refers to the current rate to convert one country\u0026rsquo;s currency to another. This value is updated according to destination country regulations.\nMerchant and accounts A Merchant is the business who hires Bamboo Payment to receive electronical payments using any of the models available.\nAn Account is the segmentation of the merchant\u0026rsquo;s business. For example:\nProcessing countries Branches Business Lines Payment methods Merchant codes provided by card processors Business By default, a merchant who hires Bamboo System receives a Merchant Identificator and an Account that allows them to process transactions. Then, the merchants are free to create as many accounts as they need to meet business requirements.\nNote For settlement and billing purposes, Bamboo Payment will consider the total of the transactions made by all the accounts of a merchant.\nCrossboder merchant A Crossboder merchant is a business that is not located in the processing country. For example, a business who is legally constituted in United States but it has operations in Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil.\nThese merchants process under the Payfac model and can process in USD or local currency.\nLocal merchant A Local merchant is a business that is located in the same country where they process.\nThese merchants can process under the Payfac model or Gateway model using local currency.\nGateway model In the Gateway model, the acquirer or payment method pays directly to the accounts of the merchant. In this model, merchant and acquirer (or payment method) implements their own settlement process.\nPayfac model Refers to a Payment Facilitator model, in which the merchant is represented as a Bamboo sub-merchant with whom they sign a commercial agreement. For settlement in this model, the acquirer or payment facilitator makes payment to Bamboo and Bamboo pays the merchant.\nTenant A Tenant refers to the processing channel in Bamboo which can be crossborder (operates in multiple countries and uses the conversion rate) or local.\nTokenization When referring to data security, tokenization is the process of changing a sensitive element with its non-sensitive equivalent. This non-sensitive element, known as the token, is generated through the tokenization process. The token itself is meaningless and worthless, except for the entity that created it. In the event of a security incident that allows the theft of these numbers, they will be of no value to the thief as they cannot be used for their own purposes.\nSince the token is a reference or identifier assigned to a stored card by the system, it is unique for each pair of \u0026ldquo;merchant/token\u0026rdquo;. Therefore, when a customer registers their card with two different merchants, each merchant will receive a different token. This makes it impossible for a merchant to use the tokens from one customer for any other purpose.\n","excerpt":"Acquirer An acquirer is a payment facilitator that allows you to perform digital payments. …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/concepts.html","title":"Concepts"},{"body":"For example, if your business is in Uruguay and your buyer is in Colombia, their purchase will be in COP but your destination currency is UYU.\nTitle 1 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
